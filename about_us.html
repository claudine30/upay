four-story school building was established along Alabang-Zapote Road, Las Piñas
City and it catered to 185 students in the first two academic programs offered
by the College – the Bachelor of Science in Nursing and the Secondary Course.
The school expanded its reach when it established two (2) branches in 1995 and
in 1996, the Molino and Calamba campuses respectively. The Molino Campus
started its operations with an initial enrolment of 700 students while the
Calamba Campus opened with 367 enrollees. From these small beginnings, the
school began to expand in terms of curricular programs, faculty, research,
community service, infrastructure, and professional development. Finally in
1997, PHCR recorded a milestone when it received its university status from the
Commission on Higher Education (CHED).</span></p>
